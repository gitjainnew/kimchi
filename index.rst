**Q: What exactly is Mochi Health, and how does it differ from traditional weight loss programs?**

**A:** Great question. Mochi Health is a digital-first healthcare platform that focuses specifically on helping people with obesity get access to **affordable, doctor-prescribed weight loss treatment**. Unlike conventional weight loss clinics where you have to show up in person, Mochi is 100% online. You do everything—from screening to prescriptions—virtually.

**Q: So, it’s a telehealth solution? What kind of treatments do they offer?**

**A:** Exactly—it’s telehealth with a focus on **medical obesity treatment**. The key part of their treatment model is **GLP-1 medications** like **Wegovy, Ozempic, and Zepbound**, which are FDA-approved for weight loss. These meds work by controlling appetite and stabilizing blood sugar, which helps support long-term weight reduction.

**Q: Who is eligible to use Mochi Health’s services?**

**A:** Generally, adults in the U.S. with a **BMI of 30 or more**, or **27+ with a condition like diabetes or hypertension**. You must be **18 years or older**, **not living in Alabama** (they don’t operate there yet), and willing to commit to a **monthly care plan**. And here’s a big plus—you **don’t need insurance** to qualify.

**Q: What’s the process like for getting started?**

**A:** It’s designed to be quick and straightforward. Here’s a simplified breakdown:

#. **Start with an online screening** – You fill out a questionnaire about your health.
#. **Have a virtual doctor consultation** – A licensed provider evaluates your situation.
#. **Get a prescription** – If you qualify, you’re prescribed a GLP-1 medication.
#. **Ongoing support** – Monthly virtual check-ins, health coaching, and medication adjustments.
#. **Flexible medication access** – Mochi works with your insurance or uses compounding pharmacies if you’re paying out of pocket.

Most people can **begin treatment in just 7 to 10 days**.

**Q: That sounds convenient. What if I don’t have insurance or it doesn’t cover the medication?**

**A:** That’s a common issue, and Mochi addresses it well. If you don’t have coverage, they partner with **compounding pharmacies** to offer **lower-cost generic alternatives**—usually in the range of **$199 to $250/month**, which is significantly more affordable than brand-name GLP-1s.

**Q: And how much does the care plan itself cost?**

**A:** The base **membership is $20/month**, and that covers:

- All virtual doctor visits
- Monthly follow-ups
- Insurance paperwork help

It’s a flat fee, so you don’t have to worry about being charged for every interaction.

**Q: Are there any restrictions or health considerations?**

**A:** Yes, like any medical treatment. You **can’t be pregnant or nursing**, and people with certain **endocrine disorders** may not be eligible for GLP-1 meds. That’s why the doctor consultation is a key part of the process—they'll assess whether this type of medication is safe for you.

**Q: Where can people sign up or learn more?**

**A:** You can start the process and find more information at the link below:
