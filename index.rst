know everything about Mochi Health
===================================================

What Is Mochi Health?
Mochi Health is a virtual obesity clinic that provides affordable access to FDA-approved weight loss medications such as Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. The service is designed for individuals with a BMI of 30+ or 27+ with obesity-related health conditions. Mochi offers personalized treatment with or without insurance, making it an inclusive and accessible platform for those seeking medically supervised weight loss.

Unlike traditional clinics that require in-person visits, Mochi is 100% online. Patients receive care through telehealth consultations, prescription support, and ongoing monitoringâ€”all under a low-cost monthly membership.

How Mochi Health Works
Mochi Health makes the weight loss journey simple and fast. Here's how it works:

Complete a Health Questionnaire
Fill out a detailed online form that includes your medical history, current weight, and any existing conditions.

Consult with a Doctor Virtually
Based on your responses, you're matched with a licensed obesity medicine doctor for a virtual consultation.

Receive a Prescription
If eligible, the doctor will prescribe GLP-1 medications like semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Zepbound).

Choose How to Fill Your Prescription
You can use your insurance if you have coverage, or Mochi will connect you with a licensed compounding pharmacy offering lower-cost alternatives.

Ongoing Support
Your treatment is monitored regularly by a medical team, with adjustments made based on progress and side effects.

Most patients begin treatment within one to two weeks of signing up.

Who Is Eligible for Mochi Health?
Mochi Health is intended for adults who meet specific health criteria and want affordable access to medical weight loss treatment. You may qualify if:

You are 18 years or older

Common Questions and Troubleshooting
My insurance doesnâ€™t cover GLP-1 medications. What are my options?
Mochi connects you with licensed compounding pharmacies offering semaglutide and tirzepatide at significantly reduced costs.

Does Mochi charge me for medication directly?
No. You pay the pharmacy directly. Mochi provides the prescription and ongoing care but does not mark up the medication.

Can I stop at any time?
Yes. Mochi Health allows you to cancel your subscription without penalties or contracts.

Is Mochi available everywhere?
Itâ€™s currently available in 49 U.S. states. Alabama is the only state not supported due to local regulations.

Compounded GLP-1s: Are They Safe?
When brand-name medications like Ozempic or Wegovy are out of reach due to cost or shortages, compounded versions become a valuable option. Mochi partners with U.S.-licensed compounding pharmacies that follow FDA guidelines for compounding during drug shortages.

While compounded GLP-1s are not FDA-approved, they use the same active ingredients (semaglutide or tirzepatide) and are generally considered safe when prescribed and monitored by a doctor.

Is Mochi Health the Right Choice for You?
If youâ€™ve struggled to lose weight with traditional methods, canâ€™t access expensive GLP-1 drugs, or want a more convenient option, Mochi Health is a game-changer. It combines affordability, medical expertise, and flexibility.

Here are a few signs it may be the right fit:

You want doctor-supervised weight loss with real medications

You canâ€™t afford Wegovy or Ozempic through traditional clinics

You donâ€™t want to deal with insurance red tape

You need remote, time-saving care
